# Workshop: Phylogenomics

- David DuchÃªne (Australian National University)
- Simon Ho (University of Sydney)


This workshop will present an introduction to the challenges associated with phylogenetic analyses of genome-scale data. Participants will learn about data filtering, gene-tree incongruence, and inferring species trees. A hands-on session will involve the analysis of a multigene data set to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among marsupial families. The software required for this workshop are [MEGA](https://www.megasoftware.net/), [ASTRAL](https://github.com/smirarab/ASTRAL), and [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). Participants are assumed to be familiar with interpreting phylogenetic trees and with some of the basic principles of molecular evolution.
